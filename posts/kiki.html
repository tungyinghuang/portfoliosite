          Robots' appearance and interface design strongly influence users' acceptance and functional expectation.
          Bouba/kiki effect is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects.
          Based on the theory, I recreate several launched robots with sharp figures to explore whether the effect exists on Human-Robot interface design.  </h4>
