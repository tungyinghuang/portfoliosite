        <h3>IDA project</h3>
        <h2>Year: 2020</h2>
        <h2>Focus: UX research</h2>
        <h2>Skills: Qualitative research, Persona, Customer Journey Map, Competitive Analysis</h2>

        It's a class project collaborated with Microsoft IDA team, aiming to analyze the user experience on IDA and give improvement proposal.
        IDA, is the first AI-powered platform for journalists and publishers from Microsoft Azure. It aims to help  journalists find the specific content they need quickly.
         I worked with other 4 classmates and finally proposed 3 improvement ideas to Microsoft IDA team.</h5>

        <h4>Research question</h4>
        <p>Each team was assigned to a specific question on IDA. This is what we got:</p>
        <p><b>In what ways can we use different AI and ML techniques to continue to build out IDA pipeline processing?</b> </p>
      </div>


      <div class="title">
        <h4>User research</h4>
        <p>Due to limited time, we reviewed great amount of literature and conducted an informal interview with a journalist. First, we brokedown the elements of journalism to understand their working pattern and key components. After that, we paid attention on what would be the potential harm in the working process.</p>

        <img src="../images/post/azure-research-02.jpg" class='responsive'alt='research overview' >
        <h5 class="grey">Key findings</h5>
        <p>We found that the process of making a quality journalism requires times and efforts on research and
          data collection. However, the news cycle is too short to screen whether the information is right
          or not. The pressure to keep updating causes the problem that journalists might overlook
          the credibility of information's source.<p>
        <p>The hidden worries of fake news need to be improved. We can use AI/ML to mitigate this problem on IDA.</p>

      <div class="title">
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>Due to our research question focusing on techniques, we discussed much on functionality instead of UI. To analyze the site and its features and functions, we brokedown IDA's every touchpoint page by page. We believe IDA wants to emphasize its search engine and open datasets. Based on these two features, we sorted out the customer journey, stakeholders, and competitive analysis. </p>
        <h5>Break down the site</h5>
        <iframe width="900" height="450" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_lBT-H8o=/?moveToViewport=1802,-4741,9754,4597" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>
        <h5>Customer Journey Map</h5>

        <h5>Stakeholder analysis</h5>

        <h5>Competitive analysis</h5>

      <div class="title">
        <h4>Insights</4>
          <h5>1. Search is the key</h5>
          <p>Users aim to find related content on IDA in a short time. Although it does provide filters, there're no preview or hightlight on the results page. It'll be time-consuming to figure out the document they want.</p>
          <h5>2. Concerns on open-dataset</h5>
          <p>What makes IDA stand out is that users are able to upload any files including images, videos, text...on this platform. IDA can autogenerate tags from the contents which helps user to find data easier. Yet unreliable resources might come along if IDA don't provide any screening system.</p>
          <h5>3. Accessibility design</h5>
          <p>In the results of competitve anaysis, we found all of them emphasized the improtance of accessibility especially for a searching engine. Obviously, it's necessary to make the IDA accessible. </p>

        <h4>Needs and painpoints</h4>
        <h5>Needs</h5>
        <p>Creating a well-researched, contextualized report in a short period of time.</p>
        <h5>Painpoints</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>It's time-consuming to manage data </li>
        <li>False information might be included</li>
        <li>Lack of accessibility</li>
      </ul>
